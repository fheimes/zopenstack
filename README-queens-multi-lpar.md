### Known Issues and Workarounds

[Bug 1713032](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ceph/+bug/1713032)

`[luminous] ceph-mon crashes when it is elected leader (s390x) `
ceph-mon will crash on s390x when it decides it has been elected as the leader - this does not cause a hook error
as ceph-mon does not actually raise an external exception.

Workaround is to disable ceph either in the bundle, or juju remove-application after deploy, which will force
openstack to use local storage.
